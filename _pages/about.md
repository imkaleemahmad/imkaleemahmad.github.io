I hold a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science from The University of Agriculture, Peshawar, where my thesis focused on multimodal generative artificial intelligence for imaging tasks. My passion for data science, image processing, and artificial intelligence has shaped my academic and professional journey.

My research interests include computer vision, medical imaging, generative AI, large multimodal and vision–language models, and data science. I am particularly keen to explore how these technologies can be applied to address real-world challenges in healthcare and automation. Through ongoing research and advanced study, I aim to contribute to the development of intelligent, explainable, and human-centred AI systems that foster innovation and positive impact.
