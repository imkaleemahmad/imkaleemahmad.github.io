I have a degree in computer science and a strong interest in innovation and research. My deep interest in data science, image processing, and artificial intelligence has influenced my academic path. With a thesis on generative artificial intelligence for image segmentation, transformation and cognitive interpretation, I recently earned my bachelor's degree from The University of Agriculture in Peshawar, Pakistan.

My research interests are diverse, and include computer vision, medical imaging, generative artificial intelligence, large language models, and data science. I'm particularly interested in investigating novel uses of these technologies to solve real-world problems. By pursuing a master's degree, I hope to expand my knowledge and contribute to progress in these fields.
