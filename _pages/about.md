I hold a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science. My bachelor’s thesis focused on multimodal generative artificial intelligence for imaging tasks such as detection, segmentation, transformation, and interpretation. My passion for computer vision, data science, big data, and artificial intelligence has shaped my academic and professional journey, motivating me to become both a passionate researcher and a productive developer.

My research interests include computer vision, medical imaging, generative artificial intelligence, multimodality, and large language and vision models. I am particularly keen to explore how state-of-the-art and emerging technologies can be applied to address real-world challenges in healthcare and other areas that benefit humanity. Through ongoing research and advanced study, I aim to contribute to the development of intelligent, explainable, and human-centered AI systems that foster innovation and create a positive impact in the world.
